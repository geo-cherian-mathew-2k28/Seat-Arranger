CSE B Seat Arranger
Overview
The CSE B Seat Arranger is a simple, intuitive web application designed to efficiently organize classroom seating for students in CSE B. It automates the process of assigning students to benches, ensuring gender segregation and adhering to specific seating capacity rules. The application provides a clear visual representation of the seating plan, making it easy for teachers to manage and locate students.

Features
Automated Seat Arrangement: Generates a new seating plan with a single click.

Strict Bench Capacity: Ensures exactly 3 students are seated per bench across all 24 benches (4 columns x 6 rows).

Gender Segregation:

Columns 1 and 2 are primarily designated for girls.

Columns 3 and 4 are primarily designated for boys.

Includes a special adjustment rule to place male students in Bench 12 (the last bench of Column 2) if male-preferred benches are full.

Roll Number Based: Students are identified and displayed by their roll numbers only.

Interactive Search: Allows users to quickly find a student by their roll number, highlighting their bench and scrolling it into view.

Clear/Reset Search: A button to clear the search input and remove highlights.

Persistent Seating Plan: The generated seating plan is saved locally in the browser, so it persists even if the page is closed and reopened.

Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across various devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

User-Friendly Interface: Clean, professional UI with a calming color theme and subtle animations.

Arrangement Cooldown (Currently Disabled for Demo): By default, the application includes a 5-day cooldown period for re-arranging seats to ensure stability. This feature is currently disabled in the provided code for easy demonstration.
